SEARCH IN MATRIX
--------

You are give a matrix (a list of lists) of DISTINCT integers and a target number.
Each row in the matrix is SORTED and each column in the matrix is SORTED.
Our matrix does not necessarily have the same height and width.

Write a function that returns a list of the row and column indices of the target integer
IF it is contained in the matrix, otherwise return [-1, -1].

EXAMPLE INPUT

matrix = [
[1,4,7,12,15,1000],
[2,5,19,31,32,1001],
[3,8,24,33,35,1002],
[40,41,42,44,45,1003],
[99,100,103,106,128,1004]
]

target =44

EXAMPLE OUTPUT

result = [3,3]
